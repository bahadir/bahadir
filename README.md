# Me

Hello! I'm **Bahadir Kandemir**.

I live in **Finland**, and work at **Unity** as a Senior Software Engineer. I’m not on the engine team, but I still get to build game development tools and create small games in my spare time.

I enjoy experimenting with small projects, trying out new gameplay ideas, and exploring creative tools and technologies. While there's not a lot to showcase here yet, you can check out my Role Playing Game project on GitHub. It's a small but fun game you can play using Github Issues.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy it!
